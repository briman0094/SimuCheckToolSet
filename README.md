# SimuCheckToolSet
Use our SimuCheck ToolSet to increase your immersion into your simulator. Our ToolSet allows to interface your joysticks and mouse into specific commands that control your Simulator.

The main branch is currently in rapid development (very unstable)

We suggest you download a "RELEASE" which has versions which are more stable.
