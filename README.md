3. It includes #include's to external files which are required
4. Use the API explanation on http://simucheck.com/eng/Pages/toolset
5. Run the script and a gui will appear
6. Use the up/down buttons to switch between joysticks and identify which AXIS / Buttons you want to use in your script
7. Add / modify the scripts inside the loop
8. Reload the script and activate the script
